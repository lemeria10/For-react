        <h4>Brief history of Diogo Jota:</h4>
      <p>
        Diogo Jota was born in Portugal in 1996 and began his football career
        with Paços de Ferreira, where his talent quickly stood out. He later
        moved to Atlético Madrid but gained more experience through loan spells,
        especially at FC Porto and Wolverhampton Wanderers. His strong
        performances in the English Premier League earned him a move to
        Liverpool FC in 2020. Since then, Jota has become an important player
        for both Liverpool and the Portugal national team, known for his work
        rate, versatility, and goal-scoring ability.
